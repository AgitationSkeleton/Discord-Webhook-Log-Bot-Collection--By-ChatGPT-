# Discord Webhook Log Bot Collection (ChatGPT)
 A collection of simple Python-based logging systems for games such as Half-Life, Quake III Arena, Team Fortress 2, Unreal Tournament GOTY, Mumble/Murmur, and Zandronum to Discord. Created by ChatGPT, I'm just sharing these for anyone who might find them useful.

How to use:

1. Enable logging on the game or program you want to relay, then edit the directory.
2. Make a Discord webhook and replace YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE in the file you want with it.
3. pip install discord discord.py watchdog requests pynacl pytz
4. Use pm2 to start the bots, eg. pm2 start q3logbot.py
